# Volumes in Kubernetes

Volumes in Kubernetes provide a way to persist and share data between containers within a pod. They enable data to survive container restarts, pod rescheduling, and even pod termination. 

## Volume Types

### EmptyDir

An EmptyDir volume is created when a pod is created and exists for the lifetime of that pod. It is initially empty and can be used to share data between containers in the same pod.

### HostPath

A HostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into the pod. It can be used to access files on the host system or to share files between host and containers.

### Using AWS EBS Volumes

 In this section, we'll explore two methods of accessing volumes in Kubernetes: PV/PVC and AWS 

 -  Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
 -  Direct Access

## Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are Kubernetes resources used to manage storage in a cluster-independent manner. PVs represent physical storage resources, such as disk drives or network storage, while PVCs are requests for storage resources from PVs.

## Direct Accesss

Directly using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes to provide persistent storage for your applications.

### Volume Management Commands

- Create a PersistentVolume:
   ```
   kubectl create -f pv.yaml
   ```

- Create a PersistentVolumeClaim:
   ```
   kubectl create -f pvc.yaml
   ```

- Get volumes

   ```
   kubectl get pv
   kubectl get pvc
   ```

- Describe a volume:
   ```
   kubectl describe pv <volume-name>
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
   ```

- Delete a volume:
   ```
   kubectl delete pv <volume-name>
   kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name>
   ```

- Attach a volume to a pod:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f pod-with-volume.yaml
   ```

- Detach a volume from a pod:
   ```
   kubectl delete -f pod-with-volume.yaml
   ```
